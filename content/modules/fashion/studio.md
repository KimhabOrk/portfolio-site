They will be required to revise communication and production of outcomes and continually plan and manage in detail the series of outcomes, 
techniques, materials, expressions and collaborations applicable to realising their project.

Students will work through a structured series of dynamic simulated practice learning experiences designed to assist them
in managing and producing their own design project and developing strategies for future independent design practice or further research.
